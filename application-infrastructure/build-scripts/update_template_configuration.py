"""
The template-configuration.json file includes parameter and tag values to 
 use during application stack deployment. Many of the values are dynamically 
 generated using environment variables.

This is more flexible and maintainable than the traditional `sed` command 
 as you only need to set an environment variable and use it within the file
 without having to update a complex `sed` one-liner command.

Placeholders in the file are in the format of $PLACE_HOLDER$ which are used 
 to replace with the corresponding environment variable. For example, 
 $STAGE_ID$ is replaced with the environment variable STAGE_ID.

You can always add your own environment variables in buildspec to then use 
 within the template-configuration.json file. You might do this instead of 
 hard-coding in case you want to set values conditionally based upon other
 factors.

1. Read in the template-configuration.json file and find all the placeholders.
2. Do a search/replace of the placeholders by using to corresponding 
   environment variable. For example, if the environment variable STAGE_ID=dev 
   is set, then the placeholder $STAGE_ID$ is replaced with the value dev.
3. Overwrite template-configuration.json with the modified file (this will
   not affect any files in the repository).

The template-configuration.json file is used by the 
 `aws cloudformation package` command to provide the application stack 
 parameters and tags.
