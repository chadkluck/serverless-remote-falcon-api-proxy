"""
This script updates the AutoPublishCodeSha256 and VersionDescription fields
 in a SAM template file with the current timestamp. This is useful for 
 triggering new deployments of Lambda functions when the code changes.

It overcomes a (bug?) in which a new alias cannot be replaced during deployment.

The downside is that even if the Lambda code did not change (maybe only the 
 template did) this forces a new Lambda deployment.

BUT that may be desired and more than likely, 99% of your deployments are due
 to Lambda function updates anyways.

You can always choose to comment out execution of this script in your 
 buildspec if you find it unnecessary, but keep it around if you ever 
 experience CloudFormation deployment issues related to Lambda versions and 
 aliases.
