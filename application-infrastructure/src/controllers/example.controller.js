/*
CONTROLLER to coordinate calling the SERVICE and returning a response using the appropriate VIEW

The ROUTER routes the request to the CONTROLLER which then facilitates calling the SERVICE and 
formatting the response using a VIEW

It is up to the developer to decide how much routing the ROUTER handles, and how much 
of the deeper routing the CONTROLLER handles and how it is divided into separate methods.

Every application will be different depending on how complex it is. The more complex, the
better it is to divide into multiple controller methods:
	user.controller.get(), user.controller.updateAddress(), user.controller.getAddress(), user.controller.getProfile()

They all may get the same service method, but have different views or different controller logic.
